# IT Infrastructure Modernization Proposal (Cloud Migration Project)
### *Cloud Architecture • Documentation • Migration Planning • Risk Assessment*

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a complete **IT Infrastructure Modernization Proposal** for transitioning a mid-sized organization’s legacy on-premise systems to a secure, scalable, and cost-efficient **cloud architecture**.  
It includes AS-IS analysis, TO-BE cloud design, a detailed migration roadmap, workflow documentation, and risk assessment.

The goal:  
- Modernize legacy IT systems  
- Improve scalability & reliability  
- Enhance security with IAM and VPC isolation  
- Provide a structured and professional technical proposal  

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement
The organization’s infrastructure depends on:  
- Physical on-premise servers  
- Manual backups  
- Single-point-of-failure storage  
- No centralized monitoring  
- Outdated security configurations  

This results in higher downtime risk, limited scalability, and inefficient maintenance.  
A cloud migration strategy is required for modernization and long-term sustainability.

## 📘 Scope of Work
- Infrastructure assessment  
- AS-IS system documentation  
- TO-BE cloud architecture design  
- Workflow diagrams  
- Migration planning  
- Risk evaluation and mitigation  
- Tools & technology recommendations  

---

## 🏛 AS-IS Architecture (On-Prem Infrastructure)
![AS-IS Architecture]([as-is-architecture.png](https://github.com/TechTitanR/IT-Infrastructure-Modernization-Proposal/blob/main/AS-IS%20Architecture%20Diagram.drawio.png))
 


The existing on-premise infrastructure includes:
- Physical servers hosting applications  
- Local MySQL database  
- File server with no redundancy  
- Manual backups  
- No centralized monitoring  
- Limited scalability & weaker security posture  

---

## ☁️ TO-BE Cloud Architecture

The proposed cloud solution includes:
- VPC with public/private subnets  
- VM instances for application hosting  
- Managed SQL database  
- Object storage for files/backups  
- IAM roles for secure access  
- Centralized logging & monitoring  
- Automated backups & multi-zone availability  

---

## 🚀 Migration Roadmap
A **5-phase migration plan** ensures a smooth transition with minimal disruption.

### **1. Assessment**
- Infrastructure inventory  
- Dependency mapping  
- Resource sizing  

### **2. Preparation**
- Create VPC, IAM, firewall rules  
- Configure storage buckets  
- Set up VPN / secure access  

### **3. Migration**
- Migrate app servers  
- Export/import database to Managed SQL  
- File server → Cloud storage  
- DNS & endpoint setup  

### **4. Testing**
- Functional testing  
- Load testing  
- Failover simulation  
- Access validation  

### **5. Optimization**
- Autoscaling setup  
- Cost optimization  
- Dashboard monitoring  
- IAM audits

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Data Loss | High | Automated backups + replication |
| Misconfigurations | High | IAM best practices + access reviews |
| Migration Downtime | Medium | Blue/green deployment |
| Cost Overruns | Medium | Budget alerts + monitoring |
| Security Gaps | High | Firewall rules, MFA, encryption |
